The subdirectories below this directory contain different rootings of the same tree, 
and the same comparative analyses on the same data are to be performed for each. The
code names correspond with the following rootings:

- `Abasal2` = (Anthocerotophyta, (rest)): Hornworts basal.
- `Mbasal2` = (Marchantiophyta, (rest)): Liverworts basal.
- `Tbasal` = (Tracheophyta, (rest)): Vascular plants basal; mosses, hornworts and liverworts in a monophyletic group.
- `ATxMB2` = ((Anthocerotophyta,Tracheophyta),(Marchantiophyta,Bryophyta))

The consensus among plant systematists is that `Mbasal2` is the best supported rooting.
